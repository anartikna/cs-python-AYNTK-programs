#setting up and walkthrough of Jupyter notebook
#run code interactively in a web browser
#evolved out of iPython
#how they got the results and being able to reproduce those results


#mix of python code and some markdown that describes what is going on, some charts etc.
#almost looks like a blogpost
#but charts are not static, they were produced by the code right next to it.
#allows rerun and observe result rightaway

#Anaconda python distribution is recommended

jupyter notebook
#this launches a notebook server in your terminal
#a localhost window in browser

#we need a kernel - what prog lang you want to use
#we can have for python2 or python[root]
#pre-requisites to the above:
#**********************

python3 -m pip install ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --user

#2 modes of a notebook: command mode-adding or deleting cells - blue cell
#edit mode - edit ourselves, click into a cell to enter edit mode - green cell, pencil icon appears

#try all the cell>>something commands on the GUI
#CTRL+ ENTER execute the cell
#shift+enter - execute and select below
#option+enter - exec and add a new cell below

#In[12]: print("Hi")
#what is this incrementing number? It shows the order in which cells were executed
#the numbers represent the ORDER OF EXECUTION
#MEANING - YOU HAVE TO MOVE ELLS AROUND TO MAINTAIN CORRECT ORDER, use up and down arrow icons in the menu

#RUN ALL - runs top to bottom in the order they are present
#add something at the top-> Insert->cell above, choose cell type as markdown

####### useful features

#special commands within our cells:
#if you put !, then it is seen as a basj command
#e.g. !pip list

#buit-in magic commands

% - arguments come from same line
%% - entire cell will be used as arguments aka cell magic

%ls magic
